# Color Detection Project
This is a Python project for detecting the color of pixels in an image. The project uses OpenCV to load and display images and Tkinter to allow the user to select an image file. Upon double-clicking a pixel in the image, the program shows the RGB values and the name of the detected color. The color name is matched using a CSV file that contains various color names with their respective RGB values.

## Features
- Select an image file using a file dialog.
- Double-click on any pixel to get its color's RGB values.
- The closest matching color name is displayed.
- RGB values and the color name are shown on the image.
- Works with various image formats like PNG, JPG, and JPEG.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
